## Overview

### The project

My first Landing Page layed out with Flexbox.

This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum, an open-source web development education platform. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice new web development skills.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to tackle a project
- Finishing one section after another
- How to work with Flexbox

I added a code snippet below to illustrate how i used Flexbox building this Project

```html
<div class="flexbox">
    <div class="header-left">
<p>Header Logo</p>
</div>
<div class="header-right">
<ul>
    <li><a href="#">link one</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">link two</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">link three</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
```
```css
.flexbox{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
}
```
